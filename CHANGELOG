VERSION 1.3
------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: December 15, 2020
Build with Mathematica 12.1

Bug fixes/Changes:
----------
- GTSGLeftCosets/GTSGRightCosets - we now enforce an ordering of the cosets with respect to the order of the element to avoid nontrivial coset representatives (taken as first element of the list) for trivial coset decompositions G = E G.

------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 1.1
------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: March 1st, 2020
Build with Mathematica 11.3

The solutions to the exercises can now be found on the Webpage.

Changes:
--------

Starting with this release warnings and error messages will be given in Mathematica style.
This change will be realized step by step. New modules or modifies modules will use the new scheme. 

In some GTPack modules code from other sources is used. This is mentioned in the 
documentation of the corresponding module. Starting with this version such modules are collected in 
the package ThirdParty.m. This package substitutes TwoAxisListPlot.m.

There is a new subpackage RepresentationTheorySG.m collecting all necessary modules to calculate irreducible representations (matrices and characters) of space groups. Some of the new commands have analogue commands for point groups (e.g. GTClasses and GTSGClasses). Those modules will potentially be merged in a later version of GTPack. The module GTStarOfK was moved to GTRepresentationTheorySG. A list of new modules is given below.

All guide packages and tutorials of the GTPack documentation were revised. Furthermore, we added various new tutorials (Crystal Field Theory - Stevens Operators and Ho/Pt(111); Handling of symmetry elements: multiplication, symbols, matrices, etc; Installation of double groups; Installation of point groups and character tables; Representation matrices and projection operators; Standard representations - O(3), SU(2), SU(2)xS; Tight-binding electronic structure of graphene).

Bug fixes:
----------

- GTTableToGroup      - was not general enough. See documentation for more examples.
- GTPhUncoupledBands  - instead of a rule, a transformation matrix is used to express the symmetry 
                        properties (see documentation)

In GTPack all lattice vectors and also reciprocal lattice vectors are expressed in terms of Cartesian
unit vectors. If you stay within GTPack everything is consistent, but problems might occur in connection to external programs. In MPB the vectors in k-space are expressed in terms of the reciprocal 
lattice vectors. This has to be taken into account if the lattice is not square or cubic. 
Thus, GTPhMPBBands is changed. One has to provide the reciprocal basis now. During reading a recalculation to the Cartesian basis is performed. A similar problem occurs in GTBZMPBPointMesh. A point mesh is constructed to get the photonic band structure information for a DOS calculation. Also information about the reciprocal lattice is necessary now. (Thanks to Aitzol Garcia-Etxarri for the discussion of this problem).

- GTPhMPBBands        - reciprocal lattice information now necessary, see documentation
- GTBZMPBPointMesh    - reciprocal lattice information now necessary, see documentation

Minor changes were undertaken in the module GTCharacterTable

- GTCharacterTable    - revision of the denotation of the irreducible representations

New modules and extensions:
---------------------------

Details of the new modules or the modifications can be found in the corresponding documentation 
pages.
 
+ GTPartialDOS        - calculation of partial densities of states (TB Hamiltonians)
+ GTFatBandsPlot      - plots orbital character of a band structure (TB Hamiltonians)
+ GTClusterManipulate - The new method "Impurities" is added. This allows to substitute a randomly
                        chosen part of one sort of atoms in the cluster by another sort.
+ GTDensityOfStatesRS - Now it is possible to provide instead of the Hamiltonian also the eigenvalues
                        resulting from the cluster Hamiltonian. This allows to calculate the eigenvalues 
                        outside of Mathematica.                      

New modules in the subpackage GTRepresentationTheorySG:
